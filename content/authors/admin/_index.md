Christian (he/him/his) is a first year doctoral student in the [Counseling Psychology PhD program](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/counseling-and-clinical-psychology/counseling/degrees--requirements/counseling-psychology-phd/) at [Teachers College](https://www.tc.columbia.edu), [Columbia University](http://columbia.edu), working under the mentorship of [Dr. Brandon Velez](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/blv2106/) within the [Stigma, Identity, and Intersectionality Research Lab](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/sii).

Originally from Long Island, Christian obtained his undergraduate degree in Psychology from the [University of Chicago](http://college.uchicago.edu) and then spent three years at [Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine](http://mss.northwestern.edu) working on various research and program evaluation projects focused on HIV prevention, health disparities, and health justice. 

Christian originally joined the Stigma, Identity, and Intersectionality Research Lab in Fall 2018 when he joined Teachers College to pursue his master’s degree in Clinical Psychology. Broadly, his research interests focus on how systems impact the mental and sexual health of people with more than one marginalized identity, with a particular interest in those who are marginalized based on race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and national origin. He plans to explore these interests formally through the doctoral program’s concentration in [Bilingual Latinx Mental Health](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/counseling-and-clinical-psychology/counseling/degrees--requirements/counseling-psychology-phd/bilingual-latinx-mental-health-concentration/) and a Teachers College-wide advanced certificate in [Sexuality, Women, and Gender](http://swgproject.org). 

Outside of his academic and professional interests, Christian enjoys staying highly caffeinated, winning Broadway ticket lotteries, bingeing TV shows, and soaking up sunshine.
