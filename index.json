To inform the development of interventions to improve pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV care engagement outcomes among YMSM, a growing number of studies have reported the barriers and facilitators YMSM encounter when accessing HIV services. Few studies, however, have assessed how HIV service providers perceive these facilitators and barriers. In total, 21 interviews were conducted with HIV service providers in Chicago about barriers and facilitators they perceived affected YMSM's engagement in HIV services. Barriers included lack of comprehensive wraparound services, lack of trust of providers, unfamiliarity with seeking HIV services, feelings of invincibility, lack of knowledge of HIV service providers, intersectional and structural concerns (e.g., not thinking the site's services were for YMSM), geography and distance to clinic, and HIV stigma. Facilitators included presence of comprehensive wraparound services, high trust in providers, a clinic's willingness to serve uninsured patients, community engagement, word-of-mouth recommendations from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) friends, intersectionality (e.g., offering LGBT-tailored services), geography and distance, lack of HIV stigma. Axial coding revealed that five conceptual themes cut across multiple barriers and facilitators, including health system characteristics, intersectionality, geography and transportation, community outreach, and stigma. These conceptual themes map closely onto Bronfenbrenner's ecological model. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of a multi-level approach to future intervention development to increase engagement in HIV services among YMSM.","tags":[],"title":"Barriers and Facilitators to Seeking HIV Services in Chicago Among Young Men Who Have Sex with Men: Perspectives of HIV Service Providers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter T.

As a result, external evaluators are placing increased focus on evaluation capacity building as a practice. However, empirical evidence of how to foster evaluation capacity in different contexts remains limited. This study presents findings from an evaluation capacity survey conducted within a multisite Empowerment Evaluation initiative, in which an external evaluator worked with 20 project teams at diverse community agencies implementing HIV prevention projects. Survey results revealed representatives from project teams (n = 33) reported significantly higher overall evaluation capacity after engaging with the external evaluator on planning and implementing their evaluation. Improvements differed across organization type, intervention type, staff position, and reported engagement on various activities throughout the course of the evaluation. Results indicated empowerment evaluation and other stakeholder-focused evaluation approaches are broadly applicable when evaluation capacity building is a desired outcome, particularly when able to engage project staff in the planning of the evaluation and in delivering technical assistance services. Accordingly, efforts should be made by program funders, staff, and evaluators to encourage active engagement starting in the early stages of program and evaluation planning.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation capacity building—Results and reflections across two years of a multisite empowerment evaluation in an HIV prevention context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amy K.

Serogroup C Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD) community outbreaks in men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported with greater frequency in large urban areas since 2010. An effective vaccine exists that can temper and control outbreaks, and is recommended for MSM in outbreak settings; however very little is known about the perceptions, barriers and facilitators to IMD vaccine uptake among MSM. Optimizing awareness and vaccine uptake for MSM is a high priority to reduce and control IMD outbreaks. To that end, we conducted focus groups with MSM during an active IMD outbreak to inform development of a tailored intervention strategy. Participants discussed facilitators (e.g., logistics, relationships, health literacy) and barriers (e.g., fear of disclosure, medical distrust) to vaccination, as well as ideas for intervention strategies (e.g., incentives, use of internet outreach).","tags":[],"title":"A qualitative exploration of facilitators and barriers to meningitis vaccination uptake among men who have sex with men","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory Phillips II","Peter Lindeman","Christian N.

In response, health departments often fund a number of community organizations to provide each of these subgroups with comprehensive and culturally responsive services. To this point, evaluators have focused on individual interventions but have largely overlooked the complex environment in which these interventions are implemented, including other programs funded to do similar work. The Evaluation Center was funded by the City of Chicago in 2015 to conduct a citywide evaluation of all HIV prevention programming. This article will describe our novel approach to adapt the principles and methods of the empowerment evaluation approach, to effectively engage with 20 city-funded prevention programs to collect and synthesize multisite evaluation data, and ultimately build capacity at these organizations to foster a learning-focused community.","tags":[],"title":"Empowerment Evaluation: A Case Study of Citywide Implementation Within an HIV Prevention Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory Phillips II","Amy K.

An effective vaccine for IMD is available and is recommended for MSM in outbreak settings. Particular subgroups of MSM have been disproportionately represented in outbreaks, specifically young, Black, and HIV-positive MSM. As little is known about the knowledge, awareness, and vaccination status of young MSM, we sought to describe this and explore racial/ethnic differences. Data were collected from an established cohort study—RADAR—of 16- to 29-year-old MSM recruited through previous cohort studies and/or by being a partner or peer of a current study member. A total of 486 young MSM (YMSM) responded to 13 IMD-related questions. Approximately half of the sample correctly identified how IMD is spread and 58.6% accurately responded that vaccination was the best prevention method; however, more than 60% of participants felt they were at no risk of getting meningitis and only 49% self-reported vaccination. Additionally, White YMSM were significantly more likely to be vaccinated and to have accurate knowledge and risk perception of IMD compared with Black YMSM. Findings have important implications for disease control, outbreak management, and intervention development.","tags":[],"title":"Meningitis Vaccination, Knowledge, and Awareness Among YMSM in Chicago","type":"publication"}]
